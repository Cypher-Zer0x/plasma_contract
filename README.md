# Versions 

1. PlasmaPolygon  

This version implements the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) deposit mechanisms via PolygonID, allowing users to undergo KYC and interact with the Plasma contract to deposit and withdraw funds. This version also implements the deposit and verification mechanism of zk-SNARK generated by RISC ZERO for the plasma rollup state diffs.  

2. Plasma  

This version implements only the deposit and verification mechanism of zk-SNARK generated by RISC ZERO for the plasma rollup state diffs.
